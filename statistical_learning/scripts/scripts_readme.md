This directory contains a colleciton of `R` scripts that follow the exercises in the online lecture series. 
The scripts have been reproduced by hand based on the material in the lectures, with some additional personal comments included.
Scripts up to and including Chapter 5 are `.R` scripts while from Chapter 6 onward the scripts are in `.Rmd` (R markdown) format.
